Technical Specification Document - AI Integration Project

Project Overview:
This document outlines the technical requirements for integrating AI capabilities into the existing workflow system. The integration aims to enhance automation and decision-making processes.

Technical Requirements:
- API integration with Google Gemini model
- Async processing capabilities for concurrent operations
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Structured output validation using Pydantic

Implementation Phases:
Phase 1: Core AI integration (Complete)
Phase 2: Multi-document processing (In Progress)  
Phase 3: Advanced workflow orchestration (Planned)
Phase 4: Production deployment (Planned)

Key Technical Challenges:
1. Managing async operations efficiently
2. Handling large document processing
3. Ensuring consistent output formatting
4. Implementing proper error recovery

Success Metrics:
- Processing time reduction by 60%
- Error rate below 1%
- Support for 10+ concurrent operations
- 99.9% uptime requirement
