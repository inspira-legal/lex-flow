# LexFlow Documentation

Welcome to the LexFlow documentation! This directory contains comprehensive guides for using and understanding LexFlow.

Before you keep reading keep in mind that LexFlow is still in early development and is not yet standardized. It means the language features are going to change and we do not guarantee backwards compatibility so expect braking changes in your workflows as we improve the language.
